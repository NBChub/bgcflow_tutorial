## Required Softwares
Before the workshop, we suggest participants to install these softwares in their laptop:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - We will use VS Code to access the Virtual Machine (VM) that we have prepared for the tutorial and also editing and manipulating codes.
- [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/)
    - We will use Cytoscape to explore and visualize GCF networks generated from the workflow.

Please refer to the instructions on each website to install those 2 softwares.

## Accessing the virtual machine
The Virtual Machine will be available during the workshop day. The server will be available at this address: `20.223.189.159`

To access the server, we have generated a user account based on your emails. To access over `ssh` you can do so via:
```bash
ssh <username>@20.223.189.159
```
Change the `<username>` with you email account id. Then you will be asked for a password which we will provide during the workshop.

We recommend to connect using [`Remote - SSH`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) extension in VS Code. You can find a short video tutorial here: [https://youtu.be/rh1Ag41J6IA](https://youtu.be/rh1Ag41J6IA)

If you can't access the VM, please send email to [matinnu@biosustain.dtu.dk](mailto:matinnu@biosustain.dtu.dk).
